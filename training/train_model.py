# Step 1: Load Data from CSV
# Step 2: Vectorize text
# Step 3: Train Model
# Step 4: Save Model and Vectorizer

#Save models as models/spam_classifier.pkl
# Save vectorizer as models/vectorizer.pkl
#use joblib for both 

#TESTING TRAINING PROCESS
   #When we run train_model.py:
      #Make sure no errors happen
      # Check spam_classifier.pkl and vectorizer.pkl actually appear in your models/folder
      # Check the file sizes they should not be empty
      # print a sample prediction from the trained model.
